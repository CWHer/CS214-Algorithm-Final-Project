This is a meaningful and memorable group project. In this project, we use \emph{git} for the first time to manage versions and develop collaboratively. At the same time, we also have the opportunities to get in touch with the latest research results, and more interestingly, most of the knowledge involved is introduced in the algorithm course of this semester. This made us very impressed. In addition, in this project, we did not directly choose to reproduce the solution in the paper. Instead, we choose to design our own algorithm by trying and iterating, and finally we achieve good results. We are very grateful that this course can cultivate our independent algorithm design ability.

Great thanks to Prof.Xiaofeng Gao and Prof.Lei Wang for providing the lectures of this course. Great thanks to TA Mr.Haolin Zhou and TA Mr.Yihao Xie for their hard work. Great thanks to our classmates Hangyu Ye and Xinhao Zheng for providing a lot of interesting and valuable views on the project.
