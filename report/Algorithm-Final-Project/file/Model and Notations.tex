\section{Model and Algorithms}
Because we have proved that a  multi-job scheduling problem is a NPC problem, it may be extremely hard to find the optimal solution to the original problem. Thus, we need to transform this problem into a simpler one and take its solution as an acceptable but not necessarily optimal solution to the original problem. More specifically, why the original problem is difficult to solve is because there are dependencies between tasks and the number of slots may be smaller than the number of tasks to be scheduled. Thus, we can design a DAG scheduler to get dependency-free tasks and use a task pool to temporarily store the tasks when the number of slots is not sufficient. That is what we call \textbf{stage-wide greedy}. We find the optimal arrangement for each small ``stage'' to obtain an approximate global optimal solution. Here, how to assign dependency-free tasks when there is enough slots become an important sub-problem which has been described in \ref{sub-problem}.
